classes and objects
class is a blue print of an object . It provides state and attribute for an object.
object carries the state and attribute provided by the class.
it occupies space . hence it is called real time entity.

objects- are defined using 
1. new keyword
2. object literal
3. object constructor

new keyword-it creates an empty space for the object.
it refers the object space to the object reference variable.
sytax to create an object- 
let Var_name = new ClassName();
Constructor- It loads all the properties into the object space created by the new keyword .
Assigns the values to the properties.


Brower object model and document object model
BOM -stands for Browser object model- It provides certain properties which are used to interact with the browser. 

Features- 1.  window object- it represents the current working window of the browser.
 2. It provides certain functions to interact with the current window.
 3. key functions are - window.alert();
 window.prompt();

 DOM- stands for document object model. 
 it represents the current html document.that is displayed on the browser,
 it represents the html in the form of tree called as DOM tree.
 it provides certain topics and functions to interact with the current html document.
 example- document.getElementById();
 document.getElementsByclassName();
 document.querySelector();
 
 DOM tree-

  javascript- It is a light weight interpreted and dynamic programming language.
  used for web development.

 dynaimic programming language means we need not specify the data type of a variable explicitly.
 In languages such as java we need to specify explicitly. 

where as in javascript the data type of the variable depends on the value that is stored.
javascript runs on the browser making it a client side programming language.
Every browser will have a js engine to execute javascript code.
ex- chrome will have v8 Engine, spider monkey, firefox , js core.

Eg- Chrome= v8,
   firefox = spidermonkey
   safari = jscore

   ECMA Script- It is a scripting lamguage specification standardize by ECMA international.
  it's serve as a foundation for javascript, it defines the syntax semantics and co features of the language.   

  ES Version -6
  introduced significant features like classes , modules arrow function, promises and destructuring.
  
  variables- variables are used to store  data, in js we use 3 keywords to create variables var, let, and const.
  this can be redeclare and reassigned. They are function scope meaning it can be accesed anywhere within the function(if declared outside a function they would be global scope)

  let- They can not be redeclared but can be reassigned. 
  They are block scope that is accessable only inside the specified block.

  const-they can not be redeclared not reassigned. they are block scope like let.
