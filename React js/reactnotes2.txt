event handling in react js with respect to class compoent.
1. binding event handlers-  in class components event handlers  must be bound to the curent instance( this keyword)
2. this is done because "this" is not bounded to the object of the class and the function automatically.
3.Binding is done inside this constructor.
this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
4. this is the most common approach to bind the event handler.
5. bind(this): is a method in javascript  that is used to set the value of "this" inside a function to a specific object.
6. doing bind(this) is necessary in class component because the value of "this" can change depending on where the function is called.
7. using bind(this) ensures that the method always refers to the current component.

second way of binding using arrow functions-
 since arrow functions are related to variables binding happens lexically because of which we need not bind the event handler in the constructor.
